The WEB
Internet (or The Web) is a massive distributed client/server information system as depicted in the following diagram.


Many applications are running concurrently over the Web, such as web browsing/surfing, e-mail, file transfer, audio & video streaming, and so on.  In order for proper communication to take place between the client and the server, these applications must agree on a specific application-level protocol such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, and etc.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is perhaps the most popular application protocol used in the Internet (or The WEB).

HTTP is an asymmetric request-response client-server protocol as illustrated.  An HTTP client sends a request message to an HTTP server.  The server, in turn, returns a response message.  In other words, HTTP is a pull protocol, the client pulls information from the server (instead of server pushes information down to the client).
HTTP is a stateless protocol. In other words, the current request does not know what has been done in the previous requests.
HTTP permits negotiating of data type and representation, so as to allow systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.
Quoting from the RFC2616: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers."
Browser
Whenever you issue a URL from your browser to get a web resource using HTTP, e.g. http://www.nowhere123.com/index.html, the browser turns the URL into a request message and sends it to the HTTP server. The HTTP server interprets the request message, and returns you an appropriate response message, which is either the resource you requested or an error message. This process is illustrated below:


Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to uniquely identify a resource over the web. URL has the following syntax:

protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name
There are 4 parts in a URL:

Protocol: The application-level protocol used by the client and server, e.g., HTTP, FTP, and telnet.
Hostname: The DNS domain name (e.g., www.nowhere123.com) or IP address (e.g., 192.128.1.2) of the server.
Port: The TCP port number that the server is listening for incoming requests from the clients.
Path-and-file-name: The name and location of the requested resource, under the server document base directory.
For example, in the URL http://www.nowhere123.com/docs/index.html, the communication protocol is HTTP; the hostname is www.nowhere123.com. The port number was not specified in the URL, and takes on the default number, which is TCP port 80 for HTTP. The path and file name for the resource to be located is "/docs/index.html".

Other examples of URL are:

ftp://www.ftp.org/docs/test.txt
mailto:user@test101.com
news:soc.culture.Singapore
telnet://www.nowhere123.com/
HTTP Protocol
As mentioned, whenever you enter a URL in the address box of the browser, the browser translates the URL into a request message according to the specified protocol; and sends the request message to the server.

For example, the browser translated the URL http://www.nowhere123.com/doc/index.html into the following request message:

GET /docs/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.nowhere123.com
Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
(blank line)
When this request message reaches the server, the server can take either one of these actions:

The server interprets the request received, maps the request into a file under the server's document directory, and returns the file requested to the client.
The server interprets the request received, maps the request into a program kept in the server, executes the program, and returns the output of the program to the client.
The request cannot be satisfied, the server returns an error message.
An example of the HTTP response message is as shown:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:56:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Sat, 20 Nov 2004 07:16:26 GMT
ETag: "10000000565a5-2c-3e94b66c2e680"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 44
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
X-Pad: avoid browser bug
  
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
The browser receives the response message, interprets the message and displays the contents of the message on the browser's window according to the media type of the response (as in the Content-Type response header). Common media type include "text/plain", "text/html", "image/gif", "image/jpeg", "audio/mpeg", "video/mpeg", "application/msword", and "application/pdf".

In its idling state, an HTTP server does nothing but listening to the IP address(es) and port(s) specified in the configuration for incoming request. When a request arrives, the server analyzes the message header, applies rules specified in the configuration, and takes the appropriate action. The webmaster's main control over the action of web server is via the configuration, which will be dealt with in greater details in the later sections.

HTTP over TCP/IP
HTTP is a client-server application-level protocol. It typically runs over a TCP/IP connection, as illustrated. (HTTP needs not run on TCP/IP. It only presumes a reliable transport. Any transport protocols that provide such guarantees can be used.)


TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of transport and network-layer protocols for machines to communicate with each other over the network.

IP (Internet Protocol) is a network-layer protocol, deals with network addressing and routing. In an IP network, each machine is assigned an unique IP address (e.g., 165.1.2.3), and the IP software is responsible for routing a message from the source IP to the destination IP. In IPv4 (IP version 4), the IP address consists of 4 bytes, each ranges from 0 to 255, separated by dots, which is called a quad-dotted form.  This numbering scheme supports up to 4G addresses on the network.  The latest IPv6 (IP version 6) supports more addresses.  Since memorizing number is difficult for most of the people, an english-like domain name, such as www.nowhere123.com is used instead.  The DNS (Domain Name Service) translates the domain name into the IP address (via distributed lookup tables). A special IP address 127.0.0.1 always refers to your own machine.  It's domian name is "localhost" and can be used for local loopback testing.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol, responsible for establish a connection between two machines. TCP consists of 2 protocols: TCP and UDP (User Datagram Package).  TCP is reliable, each packet has a sequence number, and an acknowledgement is expected.  A packet will be re-transmitted if it is not received by the receiver.  Packet delivery is guaranteed in TCP.  UDP does not guarantee packet delivery, and is therefore not reliable.  However, UDP has less network overhead and can be used for applications such as video and audio streaming, where reliability is not critical.

TCP multiplexes applications within an IP machine. For each IP machine, TCP supports (multiplexes) up to 65536 ports (or sockets), from port number 0 to 65535.  An application, such as HTTP or FTP, runs (or listens) at a particular port number for incoming requests. Port 0 to 1023 are pre-assigned to popular protocols, e.g., HTTP at 80, FTP at 21, Telnet at 23, SMTP at 25, NNTP at 119, and DNS at 53.  Port 1024 and above are available to the users.

Although TCP port 80 is pre-assigned to HTTP, as the default HTTP port number, this does not prohibit you from running an HTTP server at other user-assigned port number (1024-65535) such as 8000, 8080, especially for test server. You could also run multiple HTTP servers in the same machine on different port numbers. When a client issues a URL without explicitly stating the port number, e.g., http://www.nowhere123.com/docs/index.html, the browser will connect to the default port number 80 of the host www.nowhere123.com. You need to explicitly specify the port number in the URL, e.g. http://www.nowhere123.com:8000/docs/index.html if the server is listening at port 8000 and not the default port 80.

In brief, to communicate over TCP/IP, you need to know (a) IP address or hostname, (b) Port number.

HTTP Specifications
The HTTP specification is maintained by W3C (World-wide Web Consortium) and available at http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/http.  There are currently two versions of HTTP, namely, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.  The original version, HTTP/0.9 (1991), written by Tim Berners-Lee, is a simple protocol for transferring raw data across the Internet.  HTTP/1.0 (1996) (defined in RFC 1945), improved the protocol by allowing MIME-like messages.  HTTP/1.0 does not address the issues of proxies, caching, persistent connection, virtual hosts, and range download. These features were provided in HTTP/1.1 (1999) (defined in RFC 2616).
